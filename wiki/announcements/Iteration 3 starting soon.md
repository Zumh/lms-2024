Hi everyone ðŸ™‚

Some folks have asked for a project overview doc. You can find one [[overview|here]]! Please LMK if you have any questions. I wasn't 100% sure what information people are looking for exactly, so lmk if there are gaps!

Tomorrow begins our 3rd iteration ðŸŽ‰ Iteration 2 was mostly quiet, which is a-ok. Please lmk if you are unclear what needs to be done. My hope is that the existing code gives enough of a nudge to show work is needed for the current issues (hint hint try to use the Credits module as inspiration), but it's never a bad idea to ask for confirmation.

I'm un-assigning a few of the WorkItem issues to free up tasks in case anyone is feeling left out. I can also possibly come up with some additional work too. Please LMK! (you can even suggest ideas if you want).

Speaking of, there are a couple of operations-related issues unassigned. These can be a fun challenge (definitely different from typical dev work).

**For folks assigned to multiple issues**, please consider removing yourself from a couple ðŸ™‚ I do see that the issues this week have a lot of overlap, so I get wanting to complete multiple issues related to the same thing. I definitely don't want people to feel obligated to completing a set of issues, this is why we have a team!
Unrelatedly, tomorrow is a super informal LeetCode event for folks at the Conestoga college GDG club! I'm hosting it ðŸ™‚ hope to see you there!
